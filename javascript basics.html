						JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web broswer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span class="purple">var x;</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator asigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept to be able to operate on varialbes you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primites: boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane", last _name:'Doe'}</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting differrent code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. you can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Loops</span>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number fo times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Funtion</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
